# CS2-TeleportCommand

 CS:Sharp Advanced teleport command plugin for Counter-Strike 2

 Please be advised, I haven't tested plugin yet. And this is the first my actual finished plugin that has been released. If you find any issues report in here.

 Similar to Teleport command from SourcePawn.

 ## Command ##
 `!tele` or `!teleport` `<playername>` `<another_playername>` for teleport player to another player.

 `!bring` `<playername>` for bring player to you.

 `!goto` `<playername>` for bring you to player.
